		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Darren Yu. I graudated from Seattle University in 2008 with a Bacehlor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. I currently work for an engineering consulting firm that does designs for commercial and industrial factilities. I've been in the engineering consulting industry for 5+ years designing electrical systems on various projects.<br>
		<br>
		I've always envy developers that took part in creating the multiple website platforms or programs we use nowawdays that help the society advance with the technologies and thought to myself, "I wish that someday I can help contribute to the society like them too".<br>
		<br>
		I've taken programming classes before during my undergraduate curriculam and had read books on various programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java, however I still feel I'm a novice at best and strive to learn more...<br>
		<br>
		During my free time, I usually like to get together with friends old and new playing tabletop boardgames, watching my favorite team Seahawks play, or just hanging out with my family.<br>
		<br>
		If I were to describe myself in five words, it would be meticulous, hard-working, creative, caring, and friendly.
		</p>
